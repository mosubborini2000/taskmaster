## lab26

For today's lab ,I started to build an Android app that will be a main focus of the second half of the course: 
TaskMaster. While I started small today, over time this will grow to be a fully-featured application.

I just create a 3 pages home page i have two buttons:
1-move me to add task page that I can add task and submitt the task
2- all tasks that is empty until now just I have image
